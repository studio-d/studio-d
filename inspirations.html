    	<h3>"Fall/Winter 2013" collection</h3>
    	<p>“If you don’t look good, we don’t look good”
Do you remember that tag line? I have been thinking about that a lot lately and how brilliant it is. I recently watched a biography on Vidal Sassoon and was really inspired by what this guy had accomplished. I mean he really did change the way women got their hair done, in the same way that Chanel changed the way women dressed. And both have stood the test of time. You can recognize a Vidal Sassoon haircut a mile away and it looks as modern today as it did back in the late 70’s. The cool thing about the haircut was that it was designed based on the face and features of the client. It was soft, free to move and fell right back into place. I think a lot of the same principles apply to fashion design. If you have a great design, a great fit, in beautiful comfortable fabrics that move with ease, then you have a great garment. That is what I am striving for with Studio d.</p>

<p>The fall collection has a sophistication that really comes through in the fabrics. Leggings in a rich black on black jacquard are the perfect item to wear for day or even a dinner party where looking chic and being comfortable are paramount. Leggings with a mesh panel down the side look stunning with the new tunic. Callie is the perfect tunic, cut long enough to cover the butt and with a shaped hemline it has slimming effect on everybody!</p>

<p>The ultimate comfort piece is the Caprice top. A loose-fit top with exaggerated raglan sleeves gives this piece the advantage of colour blocking, where the sleeves are cut in a different colour than the body. At Studio d we did the body in solid cream with animal print sleeves!</p>

<p>My signature slouchy pocket pant is fantastic this season! Done in a lightweight rayon double-knit for ultimate comfort and style. The result is excellent drape on the pocket and a pant you can move in. A real must-have for traveling because the pockets are so big, it fits a passport, boarding pass, phone and anything else you might need in a pinch!</p>

<p>For on the mat, the Cherry top is it. The pleat detail on the racer back gives it that feminine touch. Wear it over your favourite sports bra or another racer-back top for the layered look. If racer back is not your thing, try the Cher tank top, it has the same detail in the front but full coverage on the back.</p>

<p>Last but not least is Cree, the new fitted hoodie. This hoodie is cut long and shapely to accentuate the curves of the body. The wrap detail on the front, make it especially feminine. The flat kangaroo pocket ads a sporty element but remains a piece you could wear anytime! </p>

<p>This collection is filled with possibility! Mix it up with different fabrics and colours and create something unique, just for you!</p>

<p>If you see something you like that is not being carried by one our retailers, email me!
I’d be happy to make one just for you.

    	<h3>"Spring/Summer 2013" collection</h3>
    	<p>This season’s inspiration came from right here in Ottawa, right from my yoga mat.</p>
		<p>I’ve noticed that some of my most creative moments come when I’m doing my asana practice at home. It seems as soon as I’m getting into the flow of my breath, building up some internal heat, getting my energy flowing, so do the creative juices… </p>
		<p>I wanted to design a collection of easy go-to pieces for your busy life. I’m a mother, a yoga-instructor, a yoga student and a young entrepreneur. I do many different things in one day and need clothing that can take me through all of it. Comfort, style and longevity are paramount. The pieces I designed for this collection are simple, timeless classics that can be worn for years to come and take you through your life on and off the mat.</p>
		<p>The foundation for this collection is the legging. If you practice yoga, or teach yoga, you know you are committed to this item of clothing. So have fun with it! Try the Blythe legging with the gathers up the back of the leg.  Pair it with the Babe top, the adjustable neckline and shelf bra make it perfect for asana practice. After practice add the new wrap tunic, Bodil, in French fleece and you’re good to go! If you want a little more coverage, Bekka is the perfect light layer, worn over leggings, to cover the butt if your top isn’t long enough to do the job. </p>
		<p>For off the mat, I brought back the slouchy pocket pant and made it cropped and gathered just under the knee. The result is Boomer, super lightweight stretch cotton makes it the perfect casual pant. Not ready for the slouchy pocket? Try Bali, the flat pocket version. Pair that with the Belinda tank, with its surprise cowl in the back, and you have a great look for going out.</p>
		<p>My favorite piece this season is something I’ve been wanting to do for a while. It was inspired by my trip to Copenhagen and I must say, it’s becoming my uniform! It’s Banya, the one-piece, in super soft bamboo. The cowl neck and gathering detail on the leg make it super comfortable and also elegant. Pair it with your favorite belt and voila, you are ready for anything!</p>
		<p>I hope you enjoy the Studio d Spring collection! It is my offering to you, all the beautiful yoginis of Ottawa and beyond.</p>

    	<h3>"Fall/winter 2012" collection</h3>
    	<p>Every collection tells a story. For the very first Studio d collection I wanted to tell a story very near and dear to my heart. My inspiration was a trip to my home-away-from-home, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
		<p>The city and its people never cease to inspire me. On this particular trip, it was the people and their lifestyle that got me most intrigued. And not to mention: Copenhagen Fashion Week.</p>
		<p>Right away I noticed how densely populated and alive the city is - there are people everywhere! Most of them are riding a bicycle. Young and old riders, wearing smart clothes and stylish shoes, wind blowing in their hair, hauling groceries or a bunch of tow-headed toddlers in their Christania bikes.</p>
		<p>Copenhageners have this sense of ease about them. I see it especially in the way they move, with purpose but not with stress.  They seem comfortable in their own skin. They aren’t over done. Their beauty seems effortless and natural. It made me ask, “How could I capture this essence of “relaxed chic” in my collection? I had to look a little deeper.</p>
		<p>Quality of life is integral to Copenhageners and style is a big part of that. They have their finger on the pulse of fashion. The fashion and design industry is thriving in Denmark because the Danes support their designers. This started with mid-century modern furniture design and the democratic design movement and it continues today with their fourth largest export industry: fashion. Beautifully designed clothing doesn’t just exist in the stores; it’s out there in the streets, on the people! </p>
		<p>The other thing that struck me about fashion in Copenhagen is; the trends. They are obvious and they are everywhere! This season’s biggest trend was the soft, silky, skinny-leg pajama pant. Every designer had their version and so does Studio d, check out the Alex slouchy pocket pant and the Alexis pant in super soft bamboo. </p>
		<p>Another thing that impressed me, especially during fashion week, was the very down to earth nature of, well, everyone! Sure there were fashionistas at every turn, but no divas. Everyone I met at the trade shows was so friendly and enthusiastic about fashion it was inclusive and infectious! The designers, in particular, were some of the most low-key approachable people I met. How refreshing! </p>
		<p>So it is in this spirit of “fashion with ease” that I launch the very first Studio d collection for fall/winter 2012. I hope you enjoy the softness and comfort of the fabrics and delight in the design details that were inspired by a place where feeling good and looking good go hand in hand and everybody is welcome to experience it.</p>
