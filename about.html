    	<p>I have been designing and making clothes for as long as I can remember. My first loyal customers were my dolls and stuffed animals. By the age of six I was begging my parents for a sewing machine. When my parents came home with a plastic “Cabbage Patch” toy sewing machine, I was less than thrilled. Undeterred, I sewed myself a pair of pants. That’s when my parents realized; this kid is serious!</p>
		<p>I grew up in this biz. My dad owned a high-end bedding manufacturing company and my mom owned a bed and bath boutique in the Glebe. I worked for my parents and learned the trade. From a very early age I knew my dream was to be a fashion designer. </p>
		<p>By the time I was in high school I was designing entire collections, producing fashion shows and making custom made garments for my teachers! It’s no wonder I had my sights set on Ryerson U to study fashion design. </p>
		<p>I’ve always been a strong sewer and producer. I majored in Apparel Production Management and by my fourth year I won the prestigious “Alfred Sung Award” for the quality of my collection. Feeling  confident, with my degree in hand, I set out for Europe to find a job. After a month in Paris I decided to head north to Copenhagen, a place I knew well, where family and friends welcomed me. </p>
		<p>A year later, while living in Copenhagen, I found something extraordinary. I found yoga.</p>
		<p>I took my first Ashtanga yoga class and that’s when it hit me. I had found what I was so desperately seeking. With a regular practice I got stronger,  focused and grounded. </p>
		<p>I moved back to Ottawa in 2002 with a renewed sense of self and purpose. I had the tool of yoga to help me through life’s challenges. I got a job in my field and found a great place to practice and teach yoga. Life was good again, but wait, what about my dream?</p>
		<p>My dream is unfolding in this very moment.</p>
		<p>Studio d is my company. It’s the culmination of everything I’ve experienced, everything I’ve learned and everything I love about the fashion industry. </p>
		<p>Studio d is Yoga-inspired clothing for on and off the mat. Made in Ottawa, Canada by people who love what they do. I hope you enjoy what we’ve made and feel the love and energy that went into its creation. </p>
